# simple-sftp-client

A simple SFTP pass-through service and React-based client proof-of-concept.

Some folks we work with aren't comfortable using old-school SFTP applications like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org), or can't easy install applications in their work environments. This weekend proof-of-concept is intended to demonstrate the viability of using a web front-end to navigate the large filesets involved.
